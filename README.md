# Creating-An-Auto-Scaling-Group

Scenario: Now after testing and moving a server over to EC2, Level Up Bank is looking to move its network to the cloud to improve scalability, reliability and security. The bank has decided to create a VPC along with public subnets, a load balancer and a auto scaling group of t2.micro instances with Apache installed on them.

Project Overview: This project has 3 tiers of difficulty. Foundational, Advanced and Complex. I will only be completing the first two while breaking down each tierâ€™s tasks and steps.
